Project I.D.L.A.: RPG with a Unique Combat System

I.D.L.A., or rather "I Donâ€™t Like Acronyms"

is a working title for a game where the standout feature is an original combat system of my own design. 
The mechanics focus on combining crystals, symbols, and sigils to create unique and one-of-a-kind spells.
This system aims to provide players with creative freedom and strategic depth during battles.
